Repository for class notes and open assignments

This should be a helpful way for us to coordinate notes, and help one another.

I learn best by listening, so my notes are typically sparse. Fork and make pull requests to get your notes on here, or to make additions/corrections. 

Create a directory homework/ to place files you don't want to share, or update your own .gitignore with appropriate directories.
Try to use the same naming/organization system for your files; it'll make everything easier in the long run.
