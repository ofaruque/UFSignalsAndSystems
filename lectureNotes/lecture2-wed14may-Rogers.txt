Lab 1

Basic matlab stuff. Not a whole lot going on here.

Important note: google matlab matrix indexing. It's not standard. Does linear indexing.

Vectors are significantly more efficient than loops.

Sometimes copy-pasta code will have bad apostrophes. Replace them with plain apostrophes to prevent errors.

Don't do the prelab section, just the warmup
